# Dictionary-App-HTML-CSS-And-Javascript
The project structure is called Dictionary. Within this folder, we have three files -a an HTML document, a stylesheet and a script file. Name them index.html, style.css and script.js respectively.  
The dictionary app consists of a search text field and a search button. The user has to enter the word in the text field and click on the search button. The result displays the word meaning, word pronunciation. It also displays word usage for appropriate words. For words where example cannot be provided, the word usage space is hidden.
